# pydantic

[pydantic] is a library for validating input data and stuffing it into class instances.

I needed to learn how to create recursive and dynamic structures for ingesting JSON documents.
This directory contains my work to understand basic pydantic usage,
as well as recursion, dynamic model creation, and some validation.
