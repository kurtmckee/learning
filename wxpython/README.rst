========================

*   It seems like many things need a parent, but I cannot instantiate the BoxSizer with the panel as its parent. Why?
*   Sizes and alignments seem difficult. Calling ``frame.Layout()``, ``frame.Fit()``, and modifying alignments/etc didn't result in a window with an Celsius result that was aligned to my satisfaction.


03-notepad
==========

*   Learned how to set a window icon, file open/save dialogs (and use as context managers), ``ShowModal()`` return values
*   ``wx.MessageBox()`` and ``wx.MessageDialog.ShowModal()`` have different return values
