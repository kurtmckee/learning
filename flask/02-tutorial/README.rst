Flask tutorial
**************

This directory contains my work to follow `the Flask tutorial`_.
It was tested on Python 3.9 and Flask 2.0.3.

Deviations from the Flask tutorial:

*   Code was formatted using black and isort.
    This may result in formatting differences.
*   Type annotations were added and tested using mypy.
*   Comments were added to call out interesting information.
